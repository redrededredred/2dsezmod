*old 2DS modding tutorial for a special someone* 😳

## Step 1:

- Download files [here](https://github.com/redrededredred/2dsezmod/releases/download/final/epic_files.zip)
- Extract **epic_files.zip**
 

## Step 2:

- Completely reset the 2DS Console and then remove the SD Card
- Insert the SD Card into the computer
- Right-Click the drive and format the Card to **FAT32**

## Step 3:

- Put the freshly formated SD Card in the Console and let Nintendo do its thing
- Remove the SD Card again and put it into the Computer
- Now copy all the files in the extracted **/Copy the inside to the SD Card + add soundhax in here** folder to the SD Card
- Your SD Card should look at least a bit like this:
- ![A image](https://3ds.hacks.guide/images/screenshots/finalizing-root-layout.png)

## Step 4:

- Go to http://soundhax.com/
- Download input your version and download the .m4v file
- Add the file to your SD Card (in the root folder where you added all the other stuff)
- Your SD Card is now done

## Step 5:

- Insert SD Card into your 2DS 
- With the SD Card inserted start Nitendo 3DS Sound
- Click next until the Bird-Tutorial-Thing is gone
- Now open the sound file **<3 nedwill 2016** in the /SD folder
- follow the onescreen instructions until the console reboots into the normal home menu (you are done at this point) (if the 2ds freezes just try again)

## Final Step:
- Launch the Download Play application
- Wait until you see the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo DS buttons
- Press (Left Shoulder) + (D-Pad Down) + (Select) at the same time to open the Rosalina menu
- Select “Miscellaneous options”
- Select “Switch the hb. title to the current app.”
- Press (B) to continue
- Press (B) to return to the Rosalina main menu
- Press (B) to exit the Rosalina menu
- Press (Home), then close Download Play
- Launch the Download Play application
- **Your device should load the Homebrew Launcher**

    If your device is stuck on the loading splash screen, you are missing boot.3dsx from the root of your SD card


- now you can install all the stuff
